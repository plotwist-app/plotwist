# Plotwist

**Plotwist** was born to bring everything together on a single platform. Unlike other options like Letterboxd, which focuses only on movies, here you can manage and review movies, series, animes, doramas, and much more.

Our goal is simple: to provide a complete and elegant space for you to organize your lists, track what you've seen and what you want to watch, all in one place.

## Features

- **Reviews**  
  Read and share opinions on movies, series, animes, and doramas.

- **List Management**  
  Organize your lists to keep track of what you've seen and what you still want to see.

- **Watchlist**  
  A practical list to keep track of your future marathons.

- **TMDB Archive**  
  Integration with TMDB for access to a broad catalog of content with complete information.

## Future

We plan to expand to include **communities**, allowing users to interact and share even more of their passions and discoveries. Our vision is to make **plotwist** the definitive meeting point for all fans of audiovisual entertainment.
